Here are the Questions and Ground Truth Answers. From the ground truth answer find the Tone, personality, factualness ,conciseness, and style from the above prompt techniques. It could be a mis and make a prompt that best suits the 
QUESTION: {question}
GROUND_TRUTH: Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances text generation by incorporating externally retrieved information into the generative process. It combines retrieval-based models and generative models to fetch contextually relevant and accurate data from vast knowledge bases, which is then used to inform the text generation process. This ensures that the output is not only relevant but also factually precise and tailored to the input it responds to.
